friends and family and go to the beach.

-Me and my team from this semester created a program using 
python that can be used when printing to promote people to
be enrionementally concious. It works by a pop up asking
if the user really wants to rpint and if they select yes a
environemtnal facts and image show up to try to persuade them
to not print and save trees. This is the link to the executable
zip folder to download the program as well as images of it working.
